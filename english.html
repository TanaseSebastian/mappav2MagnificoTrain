            <h2>Welcome board on the Tourist Train of Taranto!</h2>
            <span>Capital of the Apulian province with the same name, Taranto faces the homonymous Gulf  in the Ionian Sea and is labelled as “ the City of the two seas” since it is washed by the Big Sea and the Little Sea. Founded by Spartans in 706 BC, it became one of the most active poles in Magna Graecia. Over the centuries, Taranto took on a strategic importance serving as one the most crucial harbors in the Mediterranean. The city is divided in three parts: the ancient village or the old city, which is located on an island and, on a side, connected to the industrial quarter by the “Stone Bridge”, whilst on the other side, is connected to the “Umbertino quarter” by the “Ponte Girevole” (the swing bridge).</span>

            <h2>Ponte Girevole of San Francesco di Paola</h2>
            <span>The bridge that we are crossing is known as the “Ponte Girevole” (the swing bridge), because when a water vessel needs to pass the bridge, road traffic is stopped and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point. It connects the island of the Old Village to the New Village Peninsula. Inaugurated on 22nd May 1887, the bridge looms a waterway 375 meters long, 73 meters large and 12 meters deep along its axis that links the Big Sea to the Little Sea. At the beginning, the bridge worked through the use of hydraulic turbines powered by a great tank; following the modernization made between 1957 and 1958, it was introduced an electrical functioning. This bridge represents the main symbol of the City of Taranto and can be considered a remarkable naval engineering work for its singularity. Furthermore, the transit of the ships with the equipment on the bridge is a suggestive moment for relatives and friends to greet their loved ones from the promenade.</span>

            <span>Now, let us continue with the explanation on board the train.
        <br>
        While we cross the Ponte Girevole again, it is impossible not to observe the majestic Palace in front of us: it is considered the Archita Palace or Office Building. The main prospect, in line with the bridge, is characterized by perfect symmetries and the search of balance. It is made even more scenic by its wide Doric trabeation, by the row of windows and by the tympanum with its mechanical clock. Indeed, its sober architectural style, proportionated with the neoclassical taste, became the inspirational model for many other buildings which were being constructed in the same period. The Palace was built by the Royal decree of King Ferdinand of Bourbon to host the city’s orphans and it currently houses the Archita High School where Aldo Moro studied, one of the most famous

            <h2>Monument to the Sailor</h2>
            <span>Turning to the right, we can see the Monument to the Sailor, one of the monuments of the New Village of the city. It is dedicated to the sailors of the Italian Military Navy and it was made by the sculptor Vittorio di Cobeltardo in 1974, who chose bronze as the material. It was donated to the city that was the scene of the famous “Notte di Taranto” (Night of Taranto). The sculpture, that is about 7 meters tall and stands on a pedestal, depicts two sailors while they are greeting all the ships that are about to cross the waterway that connects the Big Sea to the Little Sea, by raising the typical hat with their right hand.</span>

It was built on the ruins of  a theatre and it is made of golden beige pietra carparo. It was inaugurated on 7th September 1934 by Benito Mussolini, in front of the citizens that crowded the opposite roundabout. On the exterior, the Palace takes on the mighty shapes of an ideal fortified Roman castrum, adapted to the new grandiloquent and propagandistic guise, typical of the dictatorial regime. In fact, on the façade there is a balcony with two eagles made of bronze which stand on cylindric pedestals; at the sides of the principal entrance there are some reliefs portraying armed naked figures</span>

            <span>Before us, rises the San Francesco di Paola Church, in the rococo style, whose construction started in 1623 by the will of the friar Ludovico Montefuscoli. Affected by the terrible earthquake of 1743, the façade was rebuilt various times, the last one in 1956. The church is now place of pilgrimage for the devotees of Saint Francis and is primarily known for offering hospitality during the pause of the Sacred Mysteries procession over the Holy Week.</span>

            <span>Beyond the gate, we find Taranto’s Naval Arsenal, one of the three active arsenals of the Italian Navy. It covers about 90 hectares and faces the Little Sea. Through the gate we can see the main building, in the Umbertino neoclassical style, in which the “Mostra Storica Arsenale” (Arsenal Historical Exhibition) is set up, that is to say a permanent exhibition of rope ends inaugurated in 1979 and open to visitors from Monday to Friday by appointment. The Naval Arsenal was constructed in June 1882 by the will of the Italian Parliament in order to cope with the ever-growing need for defense of Italy in the Mediterranean area. Works began in September 1883 and ended six years later. The Naval Arsenal was inaugurated on 21st August 1889 to the presence of Umberto I of Italy. It notably influenced the urban development of the modern Taranto due to its dimension and position. Also conceived to build warships, during and after the Two World Wars, it gave a considerable contribution to the repair and the reconstruction of military and civilian unities, both national and allied. </span>

The name is a reference to the Aristotle’s school (from the Greek perìpatos) of which the Taranto’s scientist and politician Archita was an important representative. Originally property of the Beaumont’s family, in 1913 the Giardini Peripato went into the hands of the Municipality of Taranto in order to create municipal gardens: seats, steps, water dispensers and even a Leonardo da Vinci’s statue coming from a sunken ship during the First World War were installed in the park.
Villa Peripato is also an important archeological site as it guards inside the ruins of housing facilities dating back the early imperial age.</span>

The museum consists of ten rooms on the first floor and fifteen rooms on the second floor; this allowed the creation of a chronological expositive itinerary that starts from the Neolithic period of the city’s territory, until the Byzantine age, through the Greek colonization, the Roman civilization and the late antique city.

Its structure is made of stone and it looms the natural waterway to the northwest of the city. It is 115 meters long and 16 meters large, with just three arches. It is dedicated to San Egidio from Taranto.

However, during the archeological excavations in the 90s, traces have emerged that testify the occupation of the site dating back the Neolithic starting from the sixth millennium BC.

It was built by the Byzantine in the second half of the Tenth century during the reconstruction works of the city  wanted by the emperor, considered the second founder of the city of Taranto. The cathedral and its crypt were made with materials coming from other preceding constructions, typically Greek and Roman. Indeed, the columns in the cathedral differ from one another as they are made with drums of different size and materials. At the end of the Eleventh century, during the Norman era, the building was reworked and the current cathedral was built with a basilica plan. Later, in 1713 the Baroque façade was added. The cathedral’s main features are the so called “Cappellone” of San Cataldo, composed of a quadrangular vestibule and an elliptical chapel, and a mosaic floor realized by the mosaicist Petroius in 1160. The “Cappellone” holds eight statues created by Giuseppe Sanmartino, the same sculptor of the Veiled Christ guarded in Naples. Probably, the crypt dates back to the Byzantine Age and is characterized by a cross-shaped plan.</span>

The first one is the Spartan Hypogenous Museum of Taranto (MISpa), that is the third most visited historical structure of the city after the Aragonese Castle, and the Archeological Museum (MarTa). The Museum was born as a historical and cultural re-evaluation of the underground structure of the Palazzo de Beaumont Bonelli, also known as “Ipogeo Bellacicco” in honor of the family who bought and restored it in 2002. The hypogeum that holds the museum originates from a quarry of carparo, a local fine grain golden beige stone, that is the result of the extraction of blocks of carparo, used by the spartan Greek to build temples and city monuments early as the Eighth century BC. Over time, the structure was readapted several times by the various populations that inhabited the city.</span>

The Palace overlooks the Big Sea. During the Nineteenth century it was bought by the d’Alaya Valva family, of Spanish origin, who considerably modified it by transforming its eighteenth-century style in a pure Renaissance style. In 1981, the Palace was subjected to the protective provisions of the artistic heritage by the Superintendent of Monuments, and in 1982 it was expropriated by the Municipality in order to strengthen the structure, restore the interior and make it home to the ethnographic Museum Alfredo Majorano. </span>

            <h2>Doric Columns</h2>
            <span>Slightly on the left we find the Doric Columns, solemn and majestic as they are they tell a centuries-old story. The temple dates back to the first quarter of the sixth century BC. They were made of local carparo extracted from the same acropolis and they are 8.47 meters tall each, with a diameter of 2.05 meters and an axle base of 3.72 meters. They are the only evidence that testify the presence of the Poseidon Doric temple, as the other exhibits were lost following the demolition of the convent in 1926 and of the nearby church in 1973. </span>

            <h2>Aragonese Castel</h2>
            <span>On the right we can see the Aragonese Castle, characterized by a quadrangular plan and a wide central courtyard, that covers the extreme corner of the island where the city’s Old village is located. As recent excavations testify, it boasts a long story. Throughout the guided visit, it is possible to look at the preceding Greek, Byzantine and Norman-Swabian-Angevin structures which are still readable and visible. The new castle of the Aragonese period was rebuilt between 1487 and 1492, following the new criteria imposed by the artillery’s improvement. Apparently, the reconstruction project commissioned by Naples’ king Ferdinand of Aragon was realized through the direct, most likely indirect, intervene of the great Sienese architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini. The cylindrical towers and the internal walkway are its distinctive features. The Renaissance chapel devoted to Saint Leonard is a gem to visit. </span>
