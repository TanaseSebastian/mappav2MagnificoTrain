0. Pre-departure Introduction
Welcome aboard the Bisceglie tourist train! The city stretches along the Adriatic Sea with a coastline of about 7.5 km, between the towns of Trani to the north and Molfetta to the south. The predominantly flat municipal territory slopes towards the sea, traversed by various shallow erosive channels typical of the Apulian landscape, where the microclimate is particularly conducive to the proliferation of flora and fauna. The territory of Bisceglie has been inhabited since ancient times, with evidence dating back to the Paleolithic era. Due to its strategic position, it has always been an important landing point throughout history, from the Greek-Roman period to the Early Middle Ages, and up to the present day.

1. Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II
Our tour starts at the largest square in Bisceglie, known to locals as Palazzuolo. For many centuries, it was used for horse stops and as a stone quarry and was donated by Duke Francesco Del Balzo to the Universitas (equivalent to the current Municipality) in 1478. The area features the typical layout of Apulian municipal villas. A long central axis expands into a wide circular space, with the Monument to the Fallen by engineer Mauro Albrizio at the center. Along the sides of the long avenue, the garden is arranged in mixed-line flowerbeds, planted with palms and oleanders. The paving features polychrome geometric designs.

2. Torrione Schinosa
The Torrione dell’Abisso or Torrione Schinosa is one of the four towers envisaged by the Aragonese city walls, low and terraced, which mostly followed the previous Norman layout.

3. Church of San Domenico
The Church of San Domenico, formerly known as the Church of Santa Maria del Muro due to its peripheral location, was built around the 12th century and granted to the Dominican friars. Restored and expanded several times, the church has a three-nave layout with the central nave covered by a groin-vaulted barrel vault, ending in a semicircular apse. The exterior is simple, with a beautiful window above the portal, while inside we can admire the work depicting Saint Anthony Abbot and the fresco with the Madonna del Muro.

4. Town Hall
The Bisceglie Town Hall is an imposing building with a long history, serving as the seat of the City Hall. Attached to the church, it was originally a Dominican convent, founded in 1502 and suppressed in 1809. After this date, it was converted into the seat of municipal and governmental offices.

5. Monument to the Italian Sailors
The Monument to the Italian Sailors is a commemorative work dedicated to the Italian sailors who fell during the wars. Located on the city's seafront, the monument symbolizes remembrance and gratitude for the sacrifices of these men throughout Italy's military history. The choice of location on the seafront is not accidental; the proximity to the sea emphasizes the connection between the sailors and their natural environment, creating a picturesque viewpoint for visitors and residents of Bisceglie.

6. Tourist Harbor
The Bisceglie harbor has ancient origins and features suitable for sheltering boats. The harbor basin, covering an area of about 100,000 square meters, is protected by the western pier (new pier) and the eastern breakwater (Bourbon pier). The harbor is situated near the old town, which overlooks it, forming a characteristic element. The tourist harbor is located within the historic port basin along the road connecting the two piers. It boasts a beautiful marina with 500 berths and retains many historical features that make it unique, including the historic slipway for small fishing boats called "la spiaggetta," still populated by fishermen today, as in the past.

7. Bastion of San Martino
The construction of the imposing Bastion of San Martino, previously called the Torrione del Salnitro, was initiated by Commander Pietro Giacomo de Gennaro in 1565 to strengthen the city's defensive walls against Turkish assaults from the sea. It was one of the five pentagonal bastions of the ancient Bisceglie city walls.

8. Bastion of San Gennaro
The Bastion of San Gennaro was one of the five pentagonal bastions, also built in the 16th century. In 1956, it was purchased by Giacomo Mastrototaro, who started his business there: a sawmill, where poplar logs were turned into wooden crates that soon traveled the world carrying the region's fruit and vegetables. Today, it houses the Mondadori Bookstore Bisceglie, a bookstore with ancient walls and elements reminiscent of tradition.

9. Torre Maestra
The Torre Maestra was erected around 1060 by Count Pietro di Trani. Entirely built in local limestone, it stands as the city's dominant feature with its 27 meters in height. From it, every day since the early post-war years, at 8:00 am and 12:00 pm, a powerful siren, used during World War II as an air raid alarm, sounds throughout the city.

10. Swabian-Angioino Castle
The Swabian-Angioino Castle consists of a quadrilateral enclosure supported by four square corner towers and a fifth smaller tower within the curtain wall. Access to the fortress was via a drawbridge. Inside, there were soldiers' quarters, stables, the small church of San Giovanni, and a palatium. By the mid-1500s, with the city's new walls, the castle was deemed inefficient and disarmed. Currently, the structure is undergoing restoration, allowing only external viewing of the buildings.

11. Church of Purgatory
Little is known about the small Church of Purgatory. Built in 1638 near the Swabian-Angioino Castle, it stands in the square named after the castle.

12. Park of Beatitudes
The Park of Beatitudes is a small historic park in the city, close to the sea, centrally located, and a peaceful oasis. Inside, there is a well-equipped playground shaded by lush vegetation, offering coolness on hot summer afternoons.

13. Palazzo Albrizio
Palazzo Albrizio is a historic building in the city, known for a tragic event on August 2, 1916. Austrian ships caused material damage with naval gunfire, but no casualties. To this day, a cannonball mark from that event can be seen on the façade of Palazzo Albrizio.

14. Palazzo Ammazzalorsa
Built in the 1700s, it is considered a historical forgery, as it has the architecture of a 15th-century building. Magnificent and imposing, it houses a private collection of 20th-century paintings, porcelain, and carriages. It occupies a strategic and dominant position, overlooking the entire port of Bisceglie.
